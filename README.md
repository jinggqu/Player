# Just (Video) Player (Implement 2x speed on long press)

This is a fork version of [just-player](https://github.com/moneytoo/Player). The only change is that it **supports playing videos at 2x speed by long pressing**. All other features remain consistent with the original repository. 

Please download it from the [releases](https://github.com/jinggqu/Player/releases). Make sure to uninstall the original version first to avoid conflicts. Enjoy!
